``` first of all i did this on a linux machine meaning that you may have to make a new virtual enviorment to do so you have to install venv with pip to do so it is```

``` pip install venv```
and then
``` python -m venv env ```

once you have done that you have to install the dependencies

``` 
# requirements cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt 
# requirements gpu
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt 
```

It is also a good idea to use output mode because on most computers live output is quite laggy
